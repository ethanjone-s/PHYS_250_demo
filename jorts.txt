jorts is a cat that got buttered, and he did not like that.

he has a sister named jeans. but enough about jorts and jeans.

i've got to fix up the minecraft server soon so my friends and i can log back on and try to beat the game for the millionth time. it isn't normal minecraft; if even one person dies throughout the whole server, the world files delete completely, they are gone forever. it is a lot of fun. bye now.
